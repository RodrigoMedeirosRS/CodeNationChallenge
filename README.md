# Code Nation Challenge
So three days before this commit a co-worker tell me about a Python challenge propused by CodeNation, i like the challenge and the reward (free python web training). But my real problem is, while other people had almost a month, i had only six hours. After a lot hard work, i made it, with forty minutes left. I was into 46th positio... but for five hours and twenty minutes is a good result for me.
